# mobile-application-final
Final Group Project of 4 people building a fully functional Android mobile application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose in Android Studio. An application to also use on Android Emulator and a physical Android device.

## Setup

Place a `google-services.json` in your app root directory, alongside the `build.gradle.kts` file. This is required for deploying the app, otherwise a Gradle step involving configuring the Google Firebase API will fail.
